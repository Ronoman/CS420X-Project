The goal of project 3 was to implement a reaction diffusion algorithm on the fragment shader. After a lot of debugging of both the math that calculates the reacton diffusion, as well as the format that data is stored within the textures, I managed to get a working implementation. I have controls for global diffusion of A, B, and the feed and kill rate. I added in an option to pause the simulation, which just skips the update within the simulation shader. I also implemented a variable kill rate option. This varies the kill rate from k-0.005 to k+0.005 across the x axis. When this is enabled, it results in the reaction to spread faster towards the right than to the left. Eventually, the right side of the screen just becomes a gray blob, until you disable the variable kill rate. In the future, I would explore varying color instead of a grayscale image. Also, I would experiment with other varying simulation parameters over both time and the space of the simulation.
