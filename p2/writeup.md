# Explanation
For this second project, I wanted to create a photobooth app that lets users modify webcam input. Overall, I think this worked out pretty well. I was able to implement scaling and flipping across the X and Y axes, color shifts, and some noise controls to add a bit of perlin-esque noise to the webcam feed.

In my opinion this is a great start to a photobooth app, but a few more features would need to be part of a fully functional application. First, the user should be able to take a snapshot of the current frame to save as an image, so that the app actually acts like a photobooth. Aesthetically, the app could be a little cleaner as well. On my machine, the loaded canvas slightly exceeds the screen size, meaning there are always scrollbars. Also, the canvas does not preserve the camera aspect ratio, which means that the rendered video feed is scaled incorrectly. Overall, this is a great start and a good framework for a photobooth application.
